  <p>I'm Jimmy Cuadra, a web developer currently residing in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego">San Diego, California</a>. I grew up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, and moved to San Diego in 2003 to attend <a href="http://ucsd.edu/">UCSD</a>, where I studied music technology and computer science. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Music with an emphasis in technology in 2008.</p>

  <p>I've worked with just about every part of the web stack, but primarily on the front end. I have extensive experience working with HTML and CSS, including HTML5 and CSS 3. In 2009 I fell in love with <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, and since then have been increasingly interested in back end development. I also have some experience with system configuration and administration on UNIX systems.</p>

  <p>I am currently working full time, but open to opportunities involving Ruby in the San Diego or San Francisco areas.</p>
