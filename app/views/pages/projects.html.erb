        <p><strong>More Things Need To</strong> records humorous Mad Lib-style sentences, based on a long-running joke between my friend and me. It allows users to browse the collection, discuss and vote on their favorites, and submit their own entries. I am the principle architect and developer of the site, which is built with Ruby on Rails.</p>

        <p><strong>Eventful</strong> maintains a large database of events to help people all over the world find out what's happening near them and "demand" that their favorite artists come to their city. I lead Eventful's front end team as Senior Front End Developer. I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Perl every day to solve complex problems under tight timelines.</p>
