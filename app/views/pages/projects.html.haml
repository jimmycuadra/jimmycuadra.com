        %p
          <strong>More Things Need To</strong> records humorous Mad Lib-style sentences, based on a long-running joke between my friend and me. It allows users to browse the collection, discuss and vote on their favorites, and submit their own entries. I am the principle architect and developer of the site, which is built with Ruby on Rails.

        %p
          <strong>Eventful</strong> maintains a large database of events to help people all over the world find out what's happening near them and "demand" that their favorite artists come to their city. I lead Eventful's front end team as Senior Front End Developer. I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Perl every day to solve complex problems under tight timelines.

          <strong>to_lang</strong> is a Ruby library that adds language translation methods to the String and Array classes. It was featured on the <a href="http://ruby5.envylabs.com/episodes/141-episode-138-january-4-2011/stories/1229-to_lang-a-ruby-interface-to-google-translate">Ruby5 podcast</a> on January 4, 2011 and on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2095006">Hacker News</a> on January 11, 2011.

        %p
          <strong>Changesets</strong> is a Ruby on Rails application I built to facilitate my work with Subversion at Eventful. It helps manage changesets in a workflow where each changeset must be tracked and merged individually into a staging branch. Changesets sports a simple, all-in-one AJAX-powered interface and the ability to integrate with an external issue tracking system.
