I am proud to announce the launch of Kalena Bovell, the new professional home of poet/musician Kalena Bovell.

The site was created to showcase Kalena's recently released book of poetry, "Dear Soul..." and to provide information on her writing and music to all her readers.  This project involved dynamic applications for the news, publicity, and poetry samples, and features a custom content management system for easy updates.

Help me congratulate Kalena on both her book and her new home on the web by taking a look around it!
