Today, a massive update of jimmycuadra.com has been pushed live. The site has been completely rewritten using the [CakePHP Framework](http://cakephp.org/) and new features have been added.

The Jimmy Cuadra Web Services blog is now up and running. The accounts system is now running and fully fleshed out.

The blog is available as an RSS feed so you can view keep up on Jimmy Cuadra Web Services via your favorite news reader. Simply add the feed at http://feeds.feedburner.com/jimmycuadra to your RSS reader.

I'm very pleased and proud to announce this update. I encourage everyone to jump on board and follow the blog, which will contain both company news and interesting, useful information about web development in general. Sign up for a free account and join in the discussions yourself!
