I haven't posted anything about myself in a while, so I'm happy to present this news: I have moved from San Diego to San Francisco, and am now happily employed by [Change.org](http://www.change.org "Change.org"). This move was a long time coming. Many of my friends in college were from the bay area, as well as more friends I met through those friends. Everyone talked it up and seemed eager to return. In addition to the social motivation, San Francisco has a climate and culture that is much more akin to my taste. It's also one of the biggest tech hubs in the world, so career-wise it was a great choice as well.

I just finished my third week as a software engineer for Change.org. I'm happy to be spending my day working with technologies I love (Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, etc.), and even more so to be doing it to support a company with an awesome mission. Change.org has been receiving a lot of press lately and is growing very fast, and it's exciting to work for a company whose success I have a real interest in.

Other than [one scary incident](http://sfappeal.com/news/2012/01/sfps-responds-to-two-shootings-friday-night.php "Muni shooting") on a Muni bus, San Francisco has been a blast to live in so far. I'm enjoying the overwhelming amount of places to eat, the ease of getting around, the cool weather, and the cool people I've met so far. Meeting people in the Ruby and open source communities I've only followed online has me a bit star struck.

I will miss a few friends and the [San Diego Ruby community](http://sdruby.org/ "SD Ruby") I left behind, but San Francisco is clearly where I belong. Here's to a fantastic 2012 and beyond.
