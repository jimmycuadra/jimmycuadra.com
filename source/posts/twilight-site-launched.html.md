A new Jimmy Cuadra Web Services website was launched yesterday: Twilight. Twilight is my guild in the massively-multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft. Tonight at midnight, the second expansion pack to the game, Wrath of the Lich King, is being released. The Twilight website has been pushed live for this event.

The site features an attractive design and simple, intuitive navigation. Although not all the features are active quite yet, the site will boast a fully-featured forum system with user accounts linked to players' in-game characters. There will also be an automated application system for new players to apply to the guild.

The site features a column of widgets down the left side, including a list of upcoming events and an automated recruitment chart, letting players know which types of characters are currently being sought by the guild. A widget that tracks the guild's progress on in-game achievements will also be added soon.

More info to come as new features are added!
