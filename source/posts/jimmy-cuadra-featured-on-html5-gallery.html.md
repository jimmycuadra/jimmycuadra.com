This past Saturday, [HTML5 Gallery](http://html5gallery.com/) featured the Jimmy Cuadra Web Services site. HTML5 Gallery states its purpose as being twofold:

1. To showcase sites that use html5 for markup
2. To help people learn about html5 and how it should be used and how to implement it

I'm proud to have the site included in the gallery to help support this emerging technology. If you're interested in HTML5, I encourage you to take a look at the HTML5 Gallery site, [subscribe to its feed](http://feeds2.feedburner.com/html5gallery), or [follow it on Twitter](http://twitter.com/html5gallery)!
