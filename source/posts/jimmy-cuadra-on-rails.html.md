*Update: A lot of this information no longer applies due to the [revision of the site launched in January 2011](http://jimmycuadra.com/posts/the-new-jimmycuadracom).*

The new version of Jimmy Cuadra Web Services using Ruby on Rails is now live. This is the culmination of a massive amount of work over the past many weeks and this past week and a half in particular. I'm very happy and proud to present this new version, which includes the following visible changes from the previous version:

* A new screencasts section. As mentioned in my last blog post (which has now been converted to the first screencast), I plan on periodically releasing video tutorials on various tips and tricks related to web development. There is a new RSS feed for the screencasts as well. Add it to your RSS reader to be updated when a new screencast is released.
* A new projects section. This section is home to other programming projects I'm working on that aren't really part of my portfolio. I plan for everything in the projects section to be open source. To start, the projects page includes information on my jQuery plugin, Pick An Item, and my [previously mentioned](http://jimmycuadra.com/posts/moxiemaster-application-under-development) MoxieMaster program.
* The site is now written in HTML5. It takes advantage of the new possibilities for semantic markup through the use of new elements such as `<article>`, `<nav>`, and `<time>`.
* No more accounts for commenting. The user account system will now be specifically for clients, and registration is not required to comment on blog posts and screencasts.
* Ajax forms. The contact form and article comment forms now use ajax functionality for validation and submission.
* Tagging. Both blogs and screencasts are tagged and articles of both types can be looked up by tag. The sidebar on all sub pages includes the list of tags.
* Twitter feed integration and social sharing. The front page has been updated to include the latest tweets from the JCWS [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jimmycuadra) account. Social networking links have been added to all articles for easy linking to Facebook and Twitter.
* Syntax highlighting. Code samples in blog posts and screencasts will now include colors and line numbers.
* Numerous other small improvements and fixes.

It's been a hell of a ride and now that this update is in place, I plan to start adding content more regularly. Expect another post soon with more details on my experiences thus far with Ruby on Rails and HTML5.
