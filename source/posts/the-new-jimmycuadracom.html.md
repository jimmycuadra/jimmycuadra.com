Today I've launched a completely rewritten version of jimmycuadra.com. When I originally built the site, my intent was on building a freelance business. After a few years, it's become obvious that my goals have changed. I've been working for a company full time and have decided that I greatly prefer the security of a full time job to all the hassles freelancing would involve. I don't want to deal with clients, I don't want to manage taxes and health insurance, I don't want to worry about tracking hours and billing. I just want to program.

With those new directions in mind, it was time to revamp my site with a simpler, streamlined focus. All I really need is a blog, a list of my major projects, and a brief bio. And that's exactly what the new jimmycuadra.com is.

The site is again built with [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) but with another year's worth of experience working with Ruby and Rails. This time around it is being hosted on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), where I am in the process of moving all my sites. The code for the site is now [open sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/jimmycuadra/jimmycuadra.com) along with my other projects.

I'd been hesitant to add new content to the site, knowing that this new version was imminent. Now that it's finished, I hope do more writing and screencasting.

I've also decided that, contrary to my original goal of ultimate accessibility, I am no longer supporting any version of Internet Explorer on any of my sites. I don't even check them in IE. I'm sure they're completely broken, and I don't care. My focus in web development has narrowed greatly, and anyone using IE is not my audience. I definitely wouldn't have this attitude working on a business project where cross-browser compatibility was important to the stakeholders, but on my own projects, spending any time on IE at all is literally a waste of time.

The new site is all about slimming things down: no unnecessary pages, a small number of content tags, integrated blog posts and screencasts, a simple design, easy deployment, one rendering engine to rule them all ([Webkit](http://webkit.org/)) and motivation for myself to provider better, more frequent content.

Here's to a new era.
