          <p>In this first screencast, I present the common problem of making the background of a floated sidebar stretch to the height of the neighboring content element and provide a simple solution using JavaScript and jQuery.</p>
          
          <p>The solution uses jQuery to loop through each column on the page, find the tallest column, and set the heights of all columns to that value. Here is the script:</p>
          
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">$(function() {&#x000A;  var tallest = 0;&#x000A;  var $columnsToEqualize = $(".column");&#x000A;  $columnsToEqualize.each(function() {&#x000A;    var thisHeight = $(this).height();&#x000A;    if (thisHeight &gt; tallest) {&#x000A;      tallest = thisHeight;&#x000A;    }&#x000A;  });&#x000A;  $columnsToEqualize.height(tallest);&#x000A;});&#x000A;</code></pre>
          
          <p>Remember to load the jQuery library first.</p>

          <p>Lately I have been seeing a lot of excitement circulating on Twitter and various blogs about recent developments with HTML and the recently-released <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox 3.5</a> which adds new support for HTML5 features. The questions I had that no one seemed to be touching on were: Why does it matter if Firefox supports some of HTML5 unless <em>all</em> browsers (read: Internet Explorer) do? Why does it matter if it only has partial support? You can't start moving your sites to HTML5 if only some of its features are supported. If you move to an HTML5 doctype, won't browsers that don't fully support it break when viewing your document? If you keep an HTML 4 or XHTML 1 doctype but introduce the more commonly supported HTML5 elements into your document, doesn't that result in invalid markup, since you're mixing elements from different specifications?</p>
          
          <p>I decided to do some investigating to find out the answers to these questions. My worry was that there was no reason for the excitement other than people being happy to see things "moving in the right direction" and that there was no practical reason to be excited. Fortunately, I've found that indeed there <em>is</em> reason to be excited. HTML5 can be used <em>right now</em>.</p>
          
          <p>Perhaps the first question to address is the last one I posed – how to deal with doctypes when "mixing" HTML5 with HTML 4 or XHTML 1. The answer is that there <em>isn't</em> an HTML5 doctype, per se. HTML5 only builds on HTML 4, so everything that exists in HTML 4 and XHTML 1 still exist in HTML5. The doctype used for an HTML5 document is simple: <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>. This declaration really only exists to force browsers into standards mode, and documents will render with as much knowledge as the browser happens to have about HTML. One of the main focuses of HTML5 is to keep it backward compatible, so there is no reason not to build documents in HTML5 now – it will simply be interpreted as HTML 4 by any browser not yet keen on HTML5, and your markup is still completely valid.</p>
          
          <p>That answer implies the answer to the previous questions. Since there is no fundamental doctype change in moving to HTML5, there is no reason not to take advantage of the partial support in browsers like Firefox 3.5, because a complete implementation isn't needed. Even Internet Explorer will work fine with an HTML5 document (although in order to style new elements like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, a small bit of JavaScript must be included: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/">html5shiv</a>). Media tags that aren't supported, like <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, will simply be ignored and not rendered.</p>
          
          <p>With this newfound knowledge that I can already start using HTML5, I've joined the bandwagon on the HTML5 excitement. I'm happy to see that I can start writing more semantic markup right away, thanks to the new HTML5 elements. I plan to start using it for my future work, including the upcoming revision of this site (which will also move from CakePHP to Ruby on Rails).</p>
          
          <p>If you're interested in more details about HTML5 and its real world applications, I've found these sites very helpful and interesting:</p>

          <p>The more I've learned about <a href="http://www.cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a>, the more I've become interested in getting acquainted with its better known cousin, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. In the past few months I've been making my way through two different books from <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">The Pragmatic Programmers</a>: <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ndphpr/rails-for-php-developers">Rails for PHP Developers</a> and <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails-third-edition">Agile Web Development with Rails</a>.</p>
          
          <p>What I've discovered so far is that the two frameworks are very similar. The primary difference is simply the language they're written in. The concepts are essentially the same and having built up a good understanding of CakePHP, the transition to Rails has been significantly easier. Since I had only very briefly taken a look at <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, the main hurdle in beginning to develop applications with Rails is just learning Ruby itself. After working with PHP for many years, Ruby is different enough from the familiar to cause some growing pains, but the more time I spend looking at Ruby code, the clearer it becomes that it's a much nicer language to write with.</p>
          
          <p>One of the core ideals of Ruby is that the language should mimic human language rather than forcing the programmer to write in terms easy for a machine to understand. While this seems like a good idea, years of working with "machine-style" programming cements into your brain until it becomes the language <em>you</em> use to get your ideas across the best. A similar ideal is found in <a href="http://developer.apple.com/applescript/">AppleScript</a>, although AppleScript goes much further in following human language constructs than Ruby does. I'd always found AppleScript difficult and unappealing because of this syntax. Ruby is a nice balance between the two ideologies because it still follows a good, logical syntax, but simply cleans things up to make code easier to read and understand. For example, AppleScript code attempts to form complete English sentences, like "tell application MyApp to do something." Ruby, on the other hand, still uses familiar syntax but with some twists, such as representing this:</p>
          
          <pre><code class="language-php">&lt;php&#x000A;if (!$condition)&#x000A;	print 'something';&#x000A;?&gt;&#x000A;</code></pre>
          
          <p>as this:</p>
          
          <pre><code class="language-ruby">print something unless condition&#x000A;</code></pre>
          
          <p>This better follows a human language style of expression, without turning it into a literal English sentence.</p>
          
          <p>In addition to the niceties Ruby provides over PHP, Ruby on Rails definitely has a leg up on CakePHP in many ways. One of the big frustrations I've had with CakePHP is the difficulty of working with model relationships and paginating data from related model searches. While entirely possible, it took much Googling and discussion on IRC and forums to get things working. If you don't want to have to reinvent the wheel with things like complex model relationships, solutions in CakePHP often require incorporating custom code found on the web which can be badly documented, supported, or tested. From what I've seen of Rails so far, dealing with related model data just works, right out of the box, with simple syntax that makes sense.</p>
          
          <p>Some aspects of Ruby on Rails are not any better than CakePHP, however, such as support for Ajax. Both CakePHP and Ruby on Rails have helpers to speed up some common Ajax functionality, but both currently support only the <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> framework by default and inject all JavaScript code directly into the HTML. As a big advocate of the separation of markup, style, and behavior, this unfortunately renders these helpers useless for me, as I'm not willing to use obtrusive JavaScript in my applications. I also greatly prefer <a href="http://www.jquery.com/">jQuery</a> to Prototype, and although both CakePHP and Rails are currently working toward updates for framework-agnostic JavaScript helpers, currently they're neck and neck. However, I have read that one of the features of the upcoming Ruby on Rails 3 is a JavaScript helper that produces only unobtrusive code. As far as I know, CakePHP has nothing like that in the works.</p>
          
          <p>Of course, there is still a huge amount to learn about Ruby and Rails (and the other software required to use it, such as various deployment solutions) but these have been my impressions thus far. There are a few applications I have on my to-do list, and I've decided to hold off on starting them until I'm comfortable enough to make them Rails applications. Once I've actually worked with it on a real application I'm sure I will have more thoughts on how CakePHP and Ruby on Rails compare.</p>
