          <p>When creating a user authentication system, security is very important. Guides to building authentication systems for a web application often discuss storing user passwords as hashes of the real password in the database. This prevents the password from being stored in plain text, and as such the real passwords are protected from anyone who might gain access to the database. When a user registers a new account, the password is hashed by the application and then stored in the database. Whenever they subsequently log in, the password they use to log in is hashed and compared to the hash stored in the database. Since hashes are unique, if the two hashes match, the user has entered the correct password and is successfully authenticated.</p>
          
          <p>What is very often left out is that when using this method, the user's password is still being sent unencrypted across the Internet in order to reach the server, both when they register and every time they log in. Because the password hashing occurs only on the server side, the password is protected from a compromised database, but it is not protected from man in the middle attacks, in which a hacker snooping for packets sent across the Internet intercepts the data as it goes by.</p>
          
          <p>In order to protect against man in the middle attacks of this nature, the password needs to be encrypted in some way before being transmitted to the server. The easiest way to do this is to encrypt the entire process using SSL. This encrypts all data as it is transmitted and the user knows this because they can see the page is secured with SSL from their browser. Since SSL requires a certificate that costs money, this may not be an option for some developers, especially those on a budget or those using shared web hosting.</p>
          
          <p>Fortunately, there is an alternative that costs nothing at all and will work on any server setup. All that needs to be done is to use JavaScript to hash the password on the client side before the data is transmitted. This can be achieved by including any JavaScript hashing library and using JavaScript to run the password through this function using an onSubmit event handler. This simple procedure safeguards against an often overlooked security hole in authentication systems. Take some time to add it to yours – your users will thank you!</p>

          </div>
          <p>I recently bought a word game for the iPhone that's been quite addictive. I'd thought every type of word game had been thought up already, but was proved wrong by <a href="http://www.blueoxtech.com/">Blue Ox's</a> innovative Moxie. You are presented with a 5x3 grid of boxes and a single letter at a time to place in any of those boxes. Once you've placed enough letters to spell a word, you are given points, and continue to receive points any time you place a new letter on that horizontal line that makes another valid word. Once you introduce a letter that creates an invalid word, you are penalized with a "Twaddle," which subtracts 30 points from your score and breaks the chain.</p>
          
          <p>The game continues until the letters in the queue run out. There is also a list of special "Moxie words" that give you significant extra points on top of the word's normal score. Although luck plays a strong factor in how well you do on a particular game, the games are quick and you're always left wanting to play one more to see if you can do better.</p>
          
          <p>But this post isn't really about the game itself – it's about the new web application I've been inspired to develop, MoxieMaster. MoxieMaster presents you with the board from Moxie, and serves as a helpful guide as you play the game. Typing a letter into the queue box will provide you with a suggestion as to where on the board to place it to work toward a Moxie word. Adding or a replacing a letter in one of the 15 boxes will update a list of Moxie words for each row that are the nearest to what is currently entered.  In a very simple example, if my top row spells "MOOSE," MoxieMaster will let me know that the other Moxie words "GOOSE" and "MOUSE" are very close to my current word. If the next letter I get is a "U," I type it in the queue box and MoxieMaster suggests I place the "U" in the third column of the first row. This example hardly requires the assistance of a program but it illustrates MoxieMaster's behavior and how it could be very helpful in situations where the way to proceed in a game is not as obvious.</p>
          
          <p>MoxieMaster is being developed, once again, in CakePHP. To make the application as quick and easy to use as possible, I'm also building it using Ajax via the jQuery JavaScript framework. I've been using jQuery in small amounts at my full-time job, and decided it was high time that I venture into using it as the crux of a web application. Using Ajax and jQuery allows for minimal strain on the server when the board is updated and allows for the board and suggestions to update without submitting a form or reloading the page. It also provides some small details to improve the interface and load efficiency, such as only updating the board when a letter key or delete/backspace has been pressed and preventing non-alpha characters from being input altogether.</p>
          
          <p>As of this post, the interface and client-server communication is essentially finished, and what remains is the logic for the suggestions. MoxieMaster will be available on my personal site, <a href="http://perceptes.com/">Perceptes</a> when it is finished. In the mean time, I encourage everyone with an iPhone or iPod Touch to go try out Moxie!</p>

          <p>I am proud to announce the launch of Kalena Bovell, the new professional home of poet/musician Kalena Bovell.</p>
          
          <p>The site was created to showcase Kalena's recently released book of poetry, "Dear Soul…" and to provide information on her writing and music to all her readers.  This project involved dynamic applications for the news, publicity, and poetry samples, and features a custom content management system for easy updates.</p>
          
          <p>Help me congratulate Kalena on both her book and her new home on the web by taking a look around it!</p>
