          <p>I love programming and web development. I like to always have a project to work on. This can be tough to achieve sometimes, because I'm not very good at coming up with ideas for things to build. I've completed some pretty cool projects in the past (like <a href="http://morethingsneed.to/">More Things Need To</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jimmycuadra/to_lang">to_lang</a>), but I've been in kind of a slump for ideas lately.</p>
          
          <p>Last week I watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8SS-rUEZPg">A re-introduction to the Chrome Developer Tools</a> with Paul Irish and, though I have used Safari for a long time, could no longer resist the siren call of Google Chrome and its fancy cutting-edge features. One of the things I like about Chrome is how Google is encouraging a developer culture with extensions, packaged web apps, and the Chrome Web Store.</p>
          
          <p>I wanted to make an extension to learn a little about Chrome development, so I spent a few minutes brainstorming what I might create. I decided on an little tool to help improve my workflow at my job at Eventful. Our standard workflow on the front end team is to edit files locally with TextMate, then rsync them to a remote server where the actual virtual hosts are running. I have a Ruby script I use to automate the syncing process, but it still involves three steps: edit and save files, open the terminal and run the script, then refresh the browser to see the changes. I thought it would be cool to have a Chrome extension that would combine the second and third steps.</p>
          
          <p>I ran into a snag in that extensions do not have access to the local filesystem nor the ability to run executables (which makes sense, since it would be a pretty severe security risk.) But for my purposes, I knew it was safe because I was the one writing it and would be the only one using it. Although you can't run a shell script directly from the browser, you can make network requests with XMLHTTPRequest. I whipped up a little Sinatra app that runs locally and listens for calls from the extension, then runs the sync script.</p>
          
          <p>In the end, I had an extension that makes a little blue "E" icon appear in the omnibox whenever I'm on a page on one of my virtual hosts. Clicking it turns the icon yellow while it makes a request to the server. If an error occurs, the icon briefly turns red and logs a message to the console. If it succeeds in syncing, it refreshes the page to get the new changes. It was a highly over-engineered solution for what it actually accomplishes, but it was a fun exercise and allowed me to learn the Chrome extension system and do some problem solving.</p>
          
          <p>I'll keep this experience in mind in the future when I'm aching for a project but can't think of anything to do that seems worthwhile. It's perfectly fine to do something that's not super useful. You'll still learn something and have fun doing it, regardless of whether or not the fruits of your labor have a practical purpose.</p>

          </div>
          <p>I generally don't like to comment on whatever the latest controversy is, but as both a front end developer and a Rails developer, I do want to jot down my thoughts on CoffeeScript becoming the default for JavaScript in Rails 3.1. While it's obviously not the end of the world, I disagree with this decision and I'm less than pleased about the way the core team has reacted to the community over it.</p>
          
          <p>The main problem with this change is that using CoffeeScript is not the majority case. Most people do not use or want to use CoffeeScript, and all those people now have some additional boilerplate work to do every time they start a new app. Commenting the CoffeeScript gem out of the Gemfile to disable it is also unintutive compared to a command line option on app generation. It's not the most painful thing ever, but it's an extra step that must now be taken just to start with a clean slate. It sacrifices the convenience of the majority for the convenience of the minority, which goes against the rapid productivity and convention over configuration that people like me love Rails for.</p>
          
          <p>I don't think this change is really about promoting the next greatest technology. I think it strongly illustrates that, in the end, Rails just uses whatever DHH prefers. There's only one explanation for why CoffeeScript should be default and SASS/Compass, HAML, and RSpec should not: it's DHH's opinion. If he happened to dislike CoffeeScript and like RSpec, I guarantee CoffeeScript would not be default and RSpec would.</p>
          
          <p>A lot of people felt strongly about this change, and the Rails core team took a very "us against them" attitude in their response, calling people whiners, complainers, and trolls, who don't appreciate what has been given to them. I think that's a horrible, unconstructive attitude to take toward the very people who have made the framework successful: the users. People are empassioned about it because they love the framework and have a vested interest in seeing it continue to improve and succeed.</p>
          
          <p>The arrogance of DHH and some of the other team members is by far my least favorite part of the Rails ecosystem. No single person is a god whose every opinion is correct just because of their past success. No one running an open source project should have a "you owe me" attitude about their users. If you have an entitlement complex, you're missing one of the most important aspects of open source software.</p>

          <p><strong>to_lang</strong> is a gem I wrote for doing translations with the Google Translate API. It adds magic translation methods directly to strings, so you can run things like <code>"How's it going?".to_spanish</code> and <code>"I hope everyone is okay!".from_english_to_japanese</code>.</p>
          
          <p>I just released version 0.3.0, which adds two great new features: batch translations using arrays and a command line utility. All the methods that were previously available to strings are now available to arrays as well, so you can do this:</p>
          
          <pre><code class="language-ruby">["Uno", "Dos", "Tres"].to_english&#x000A;# =&gt; ["One", "Two", "Three"]&#x000A;</code></pre>
          
          <p>As you can see, this is much simpler than looping through a collection of strings and calling a translation method on each one. It's also much more efficient because it only makes one HTTP request to the API.</p>
          
          <p>The command line utility gives you a quick and dirty way to run a translation directly from the shell. You run it like this:</p>
          
          <pre><code>$ to_lang --key YOUR_API_KEY --to es "hello world"&#x000A;hola mundo&#x000A;</code></pre>
          
          <p>You can translate multiple strings at once by simply passing more parameters. If your API key is available in the environment variable <code>GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY</code>, you can leave out the <code>--key</code> option. You can specify the source language with the <code>--from</code> option as well.</p>
          
          <pre><code>$ to_lang --from en --to es one two three&#x000A;uno&#x000A;dos&#x000A;tres&#x000A;</code></pre>
          
          <p>Give it a try! I hope you find it useful and fun!</p>
