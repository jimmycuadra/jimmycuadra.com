          <p>This past Saturday, <a href="http://html5gallery.com/">HTML5 Gallery</a> featured the Jimmy Cuadra Web Services site. HTML5 Gallery states its purpose as being twofold:</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li>To showcase sites that use html5 for markup</li>
            <li>To help people learn about html5 and how it should be used and how to implement it</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>I'm proud to have the site included in the gallery to help support this emerging technology. If you're interested in HTML5, I encourage you to take a look at the HTML5 Gallery site, <a href="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/html5gallery">subscribe to its feed</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/html5gallery">follow it on Twitter</a>!</p>

          </div>
          <p>When I first heard about <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/">CSS 3 transitions</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/">CSS 3 animations</a>, I didn't really think it was a good idea. One of the main purposes of CSS has been to separate presentational information from structural markup and data. This seemed like a good set up: HTML for structure and data, CSS for presentation, and JavaScript for behavior. Adding behavioral elements to CSS that should be done in JavaScript seemed like it was blurring the lines in a bad way.</p>
          
          <p>I think in order to see the value of CSS 3 transitions and animations, it's necessary to rethink what "presentation" and "behavior" really are. Developers have gotten used to thinking of presentation as the answer to simpler questions like, "what color is the text?" and "how much space should exist between menu items?" JavaScript has been used for almost everything involving dynamic and interactive styling on a page.</p>
          
          <aside>*Note: The site has been redesigned since this post was written so this aside no longer applies. I will leave it here for posterity.*<br />
          To put some of these new CSS 3 features into action in my own work, I've updated the main navigation here on jimmycuadra.com to use one effect from each module. The currently selected menu item now slowly pulses between white and blue, and the text color and shadows on the other menu items fade in and out as the mouse moves over them. For those using a browser based on [Webkit](http://webkit.org/), such as [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) or [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/), you'll be able to see these new effects. For everyone else, enjoy the new text shadows, and think of giving [Webkit](http://webkit.org/) a try.</aside>
          
          <p>The key thing to realize is that a lot of the things JavaScript has been used for <em>are</em> presentational, and have been done to close the gaps where CSS features were lacking. Take rounded borders, for example. Until CSS 3, this was achieved through either images or JavaScript. But it's clear to everyone that this is strictly presentational and didn't really fit as a task for JavaScript. The CSS 3 border radius property finally offers a solution to this common problem without fudging it with JavaScript or images.</p>
          
          <p>CSS 3 transitions and animations are really no different. The reason I thought they were out of place at first is that they involve the manipulation of elements on the page, making things move and change. That sure sounds like behavior. Well, in a way, it is, but it's also <em>presentational behavior</em>. Links that change color on hover are ubiquitous presentational behavior, so why wouldn't it be presentational to have the color visually transition from one to the other instead of switching instantly?</p>
          
          <p>Instead of thinking of presentation as what things look like and behavior as what things do, we should think of presentation as anything that doesn't fundamentally alter the page, and behavior as anything that manipulates document structure or data, or that facilitates explicit user interaction.</p>

          </div>
          <p>The web has been abuzz over the newly introduced <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2009/09/introducing-google-chrome-frame.html">Google Chrome Frame</a> plugin in the last few days. Web developers have been rejoicing this new innovation in the <a href="http://www.bringdownie6.com/">campaign</a> to kill <a href="http://ie6update.com/">Internet Explorer 6</a> (and 7), and Microsoft has predictably <a href="http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/09/microsoft-google-chrome-frame-makes-ie-less-secure.ars">cried about it</a>.</p>
          
          <p>My initial reaction was jubilant as well, but after a bit of thought, I have to wonder how much difference Chrome Frame can actually make. As is commonly mentioned in the discussion on phasing out IE6, most of the people still using the browser fall into two categories:</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li>People who can't upgrade due to restrictions by an IT department (usually corporate settings where legacy software depends on IE6)</li>
            <li>People who don't know or care what a web browser is</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>I've done my fair share of promoting modern browsers like Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome over Internet Explorer whenever the subject arises. I've even made a few sites that include warning messages for old IE users that their browsers are outdated and may not perform well, urging them to upgrade to one of the aforementioned superior candidates. I'd be willing to bet that the number of times messages like that have actually prompted someone to switch from IE could be counted on one hand (or at least very few hands). The issue remains: people don't upgrade because they can't or because they just don't care.</p>
          
          <p>Let's consider the <em>can'ts</em> first. While Google Chrome Frame is ingenious, it's still just a plugin, and its success hinges entirely on the presumption that the plugin will be installed. If someone is restricted to using IE6 at work because of a corporate policy, what are the chances that such a corporation would also allow plugins to be installed without policy-level approval? Flash is really the only ubiquitous third-party plugin, and it took years for it to achieve that status. Chrome Frame only changes the situation for corporate users if they're able to even install the plugin, and that's assuming that said corporate users don't cross into the "don't care" category as well.</p>
          
          <p>The situation of the <em>don't cares</em> is a more frightening proposition. Those of us who develop for the web or have any degree of web savvy take for granted that the basic concepts of the Internet are understood by all. But the truth is, many people don't know the difference between a web browser, a search engine, and <a href="http://almost.done21.com/2009/04/announcing-ie6-update-help-kill-internet-explorer-6/">even the Internet itself</a>. Google has even documented this depressing fact with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4MwTvtyrUQ">video</a>. Are we really to expect that someone who can't differentiate between Internet Explorer and the Yahoo search engine will install a plugin like Google Chrome Frame, let alone understand what it is?</p>
          
          <p>The bottom line is that in order for Google Chrome Frame to make any difference, it has to be installed, and the situations where it seems likely to be installed are only the situations where Internet Explorer wasn't being used in the first place. As a result, it doesn't seem like web developers will be able to stop supporting IE6 and 7 because they can't assume the plugin will be installed. It becomes the same battle as whether or not to support non-JavaScript versions of web applications, only much more of a concern because the number of people running IE without Google Chrome Frame is astronomically higher than the number of people running browsers without JavaScript. All this said, I hope that as the situation develops, my reasoning is proven wrong somehow and that Google Chrome Frame is able to speed up the death of Internet Explorer 6 and 7.</p>
